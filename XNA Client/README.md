NuclearWinter
=============

_NuclearWinter_ is a set of libraries to develop games and applications using XNA and [MonoGame](http://github.com/mono/monogame).

This repository contains the core of NuclearWinter, featuring game state management, screen resolution handling, an input manager and an user interface library.

NuclearWinter used to contain the VectorLevel library for rendering 2D levels based on SVG files edited with [Inkscape](http://inksape.org/), but it has been removed for now as it is currently unmaintained. You can still find it in older revisions. It might be ressurected as a separate repository at some point in the future.

NuclearWinter is distributed under the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt). Feel free to use it in your own projects! Contributions are welcome too.

Development
-----------

NuclearWinter development is led by [Elisée Maurer](http://twitter.com/elisee). NuclearWinter powers both [CraftStudio](http://craftstud.io/), a 3d real-time cooperative game-making platform and the 2D multiplayer arcade game [QuadSmash](http://quadsmash.com/).
